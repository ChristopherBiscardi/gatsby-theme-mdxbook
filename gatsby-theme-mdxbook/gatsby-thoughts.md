Random Gatsby thoughts

- Querying the filesystem through GraphQL and the plugins is wonderful
- The docs are both great and confusing; the newcomer docs are so straight-forward, but diving past that gets hard. Things are still stubbed out, but I've seen the Gatsby team super welcome to PRs.
- The lifecycle can be confusing (onCreateWebpackPlugin is after createPage)
- Passing a filename as a Field makes it a file?
