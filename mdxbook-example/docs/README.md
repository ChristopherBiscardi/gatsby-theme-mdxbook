# Hello!

The very, very, very first version of `gatsby-theme-mdxbook`.

## Sidebar Nav

Look at it go

### But not here

The Sidebar Navigation looks for the lowest header depth (e.g., h1 vs h2 vs h3), and puts that header depth and the one lower in the sidebar navigator. This paragraph is in a `<h3>` block, so it won't appear in the sidebar nav.
