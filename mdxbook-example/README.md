# README

**Getting Started**
This example site is in a yarn workspace, so requires you to close down the entire repo for now. I'll get it up on Netlify soon! For now, it's all local.

Install the dependencies, then run `yarn docs:serve` to boot up a web server. Run `yarn docs:build` to run `gatsby build` and generate a static site to deploy.

```
yarn
yarn docs:serve
```
